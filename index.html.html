            <p>Cloud computing is one of the most popular technologies that has become an integral part of the computing world nowadays.<br> The usage and popularity of cloud computing is increasing every day and is expected to increase further.
             Many frequent Internet users are heavily dependent on cloud-based applications for their day-to-day activities in both
              professional and personal life. Cloud computing has emerged as a technology to realize the utility model of com
              puting while using Internet for accessing applications. The past decades have witnessed the success of centraliz
              ed computing infrastructures in many application domains. Then, the emergence of the Internet brought numerous users of 
              remote applications based on the technologies of distributed computing. Research in distributed computing
               gave birth to the development of grid computing. Though grid is based on distributed computing, the conceptual basis 
               for grid is somewhat different. Computing with grid enabled researchers to do computationally intensive 
               tasks by using limited infrastructure that was available with them and with the support of high 
               processing power that could be provided by any third party, and thus allowing the researchers to use grid computing, which was
                one of the first attempts to provide computing resources to users on payment basis. This technology indeed became
                 popular and is being used even now. An associated problem with grid technology was that it could only 
                 be used by a certain group of people and it was not open to the public. Cloud computing in simple terms is further 
                 extension and variation of grid computing, in which a market-oriented aspect is added. Though there 
                 are several other important technical differences, this is one of the major differences between grid and cloud.
                  Thus came cloud computing, which is now being used as a public utility computing software and is accessible 
                  by almost every person through the Internet. Apart from this, there are several other properties that make cloud popular and 
                  unique. In cloud, the resources are metered, and a user pays according to the usage. Cloud can also support a 
                  continuously varying user demands without affecting the performance, and it is always available for use without
                   any restrictions. The users can access cloud from any device, thus reaching a wider range of people. There are several
                    applications of cloud computing already being witnessed and experienced. As cloud is elastic, it can be used in places where varying
                     load is one of the main characteristics. It can also be used where on-demand access is required. Similarly,
                      because of its property of multitenancy, it can be used in places where several applications are to be operated. Cloud computing can
                       also be used for data-intensive applications for data analytics and several data-related tasks.
